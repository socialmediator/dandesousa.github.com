My roommate just got a kitten and we decided to allow it to interact
with our ferrets. Seems that it likes to have a good tussle with my
ferret Jean-Luc. Right now it's not much of a challenge, but should be
interesting to see what happens when the cat gets older. Here is part 1
of a series I'll be updating every few weeks.
