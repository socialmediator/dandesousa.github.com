A while back the vacuum in our apartment stopped working so I decided to
do something I always wanted: Get a roomba. So far its been great and it
keeps the carpet clean with minimum effort.

However, we have encountered some problems where the Roomba occasionally
makes a repeated clicking noise and then shuts off. It then repeats
"Please Clean Roomba's Brushes". It got to the point where it was making
the clicking noise EVERY time it was run and would shut down after about
2 minutes. I tried reseting the battery, cleaning the
brushes...everything. Finally I realized what was wrong. I wasn't
cleaning the brushes properly. If you have a lot of dirt in your carpet
or pets (we have cats), it's easy for fibers to get wrapped around some
of the moving parts of the roomba brush.

So to fix the problem simply remove the brushes from the Roomba as your
normally would to clean them. However, check under the yellow cap at the
end of both brushes (by that I mean the brush and the rubber roller).
Don't worry, they are designed to come off, so you can pull on them.
Afterwards you may see something like this:

Just pull out all the hair and fibers with a pencil or paper clip and
replace the yellow cap. Afterwards your roomba will be good as new! Be
aware though, that this is likely to happen again so make sure you
periodically clean under the cap of both brush attachments.
