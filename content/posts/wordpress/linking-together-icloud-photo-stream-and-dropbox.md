Looking for a way to link together iCloud and Dropbox to manage your
photos? Look no further; the following is a guide to getting your iOS
and Photo Stream photos automatically into Dropbox.

Background
----------

This  process started because I was looking for a way to manage all my
photos on my iPad. I want to take pictures with my DSLR or point and
shoot, download them to my iPad with the camera connection kit, and have
them automatically added to my cloud or local photo library.
Unfortunately many of the photo management services on the iPad are
lacking, and it is not easy to create and sync albums through iCloud.
What I really wanted was a permanent backup solution for photos on my
iPad. It would also be nice to be able to manage my photos with a third
party application like Picasa. That's when I thought to use Photo Stream
as a delivery mechanism to upload photos to Dropbox. I trust Dropbox to
keep my photos safe, and I like having access to all my photos on all my
devices. Of course, all these photos are going to take up a lot of space
over time. I cover the costs of this setup in the last section.

Setup
-----

This setup will work on Windows or Mac, but I'll go over the
instructions for Windows. If there are requests I can post directions
for OS X, though it should be pretty straightforward from the following.

You'll need these applications:

[Dropbox][]


[iCloud Control Panel][]

These instructions have you setup iCloud Control Panel to download your
Photo Stream uploaded photos (which includes all photos added to your
iOS through either the camera app or the camera connection kit) a
Dropbox folder.

First you'll want to make sure Dropbox is configured and setup for your
account.

Second after you install the iCloud Control Panel, you want to find it
under Control Panel \> iCloud. You should see something like this:

Select options next to Photo Stream:

Make sure that "My Photo Stream" is selected. Also check "Shared Photo
Streams" if you use that feature. Select "Change" next to "Photo Stream
location" and navigate to your Dropbox directory. You can either select
the Photos directory. In the follow example I've created a dedicated
directory just for my Photo Stream photos:

Don't worry about the directories under "Photo Streams" they will appear
once your computer starts download photos from Apple. Once it's
selected, select "OK" all the way until you get back to the main control
panel window and close it.

From now on, all new pictures on your iOS device will automatically be
downloaded to your local machine, and since the location of the download
is in Dropbox, it will be uploaded to your Dropbox account as well.

Benefits
--------

You might be asking why go through to the trouble of doing this. Well
there are a number of benefits:

1.  You can access all your photos on all your devices, computers and on
    the web securely.
2.  Manage your photo library solely from your iPad, iPhone with Dropbox
    and the Photos app.
3.  Freedom to delete old photos from your iOS device without fear that
    they will disappear from iCloud after 30 days or when your 1000
    photo limit is reached. If dropbox is installed on your iOS device,
    you can even view them there long after they've disappeared from
    Photo Stream.
4.  Automatically download photos to all your computers at once (as long
    as your computer with iCloud Control Panel is running)
5.  Automatically upload photos to all your iOS devices from any
    computer in the world or the web by dropping them in the Photo
    Stream \> Uploads folder (as long as your iCloud Control Panel
    computer is running)
6.  "Own" all your photos, organize them into albums and make them
    accessible.


Long Term Costs
---------------

This setup does not come without its costs. While iCloud and Photo
Stream are free for Photos, a new dropbox free user probably doesn't
have much room to be storing their entire photo library. In the long
term this will like depend on having a paid account. However, fret not,
since Dropbox is always running a number of promotions to increase
available space. The biggest is the [Dropbox Space Race][] and [referral
program][]. You can also [Dropbox's pricing details][] which have
recently expanded. Furthermore, with the decrease in price of storage,
we should see costs come down and capacity go up in the coming years.

Please feel free to comment or suggest alternate setups. So far this has
been working quite well and allowing me to leverage the best of both of
these great cloud services.
