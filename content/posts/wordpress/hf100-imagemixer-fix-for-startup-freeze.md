So I just got a new camcorder thanks to now qualifying for the US
stimulus package from back in April. I was looking around for something
to help stimulate the economy and decided that I should get a camcorder
while prices are low and money is high. Anyway, the HF100 is flash based
and really nice. It records in full HD 1080p with pretty decent picture
quality, though I have yet to record in full light setting (outside). So
far I only have sort of dim shots indoors of my roommate's cats and my
ferret.

Anyway in my commitment to making a post with something useful every
week, I've decided to share a tip with the world. Seems as though when I
installed my ImageMixer 3 SE software, it would just freeze upon
startup. Normally I wouldn't mind the issue with crap proprietary
software, but there is no easy way to edit .MTS/M2TS files without
converting and losing quality. Since I prefer to keep the originals as
well as edit them so that extra footage is chopped off, I needed to
figure out what was wrong. After some digging I found the solution to my
problem.

If this occurs for you, you need to install all third party codec packs
you installed. I had the CCCP (Community Codec Pak), which is useful for
watching MKVs. Unfortunately, that was messing up something, so I had to
uninstall it. I found numerous posts talking about uninstalling codec
packs, so that's probably the way to go.

Unfortunately, that eliminates the ability to play back MKV's in WMV. I
don't have a solution for this but I suggest installing [VLC][]. It is
wonderful and plays everything.
