So I did a presentation a couple years ago on NES Rom editting and I
learned a lot about how to do some simple rom hacking and how old school
cheat tools like game genie and game shark worked. Anyway I've decided
to share the presentation I gave as well as all the resources I used.
Everything is totally open. Everything I used to make the presentation
below is included in the zip file and I even wrote up a quick little
tool in .NET to translate text to dragon warrior tile entries. Anyway
feel free to edit it as much as you'd like, but if you do anything cool
with it I'd like to know so just shoot me an e-mail or leave some info
in the comments.
