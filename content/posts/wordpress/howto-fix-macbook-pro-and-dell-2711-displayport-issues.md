I chose to get the Dell U2711 mostly due to PC compatibility and price
advantages over the Cinema Display. However, having a MacBook Pro I
wanted to also connect it to Â my nice display. I ordered a
Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable and all worked fine until one day
it didn't. The screen was black and no signal was being delivered
between my MacBook Pro and the display. I tested with my girlfriend's
computer and the problem persisted. I ordered yet another cable and the
problem still persisted!

I knew something was wrong with the display. Finally I solved my problem
in the most simple way:

**While the monitor was on, I pulled the U2711's power cable and waited
about 15-30 seconds. I plugged the monitor back in and switch to
DisplayPort and it worked perfected!**

Obviously something is wrong with Dell's monitor in this instance, but
this simple fix should help everyone having headaches with this like me.
