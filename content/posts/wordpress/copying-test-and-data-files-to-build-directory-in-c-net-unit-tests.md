Unit testing with VS2010's built in unit testing facilities is
especiallyÂ convenient. However it is no always clear how to specific
that an entire directory should be copied into the build / test
directory as data. Aside from setting up pre- and post- build rules,
VS2010 comes with a way to automatically include any project or
referenced directories and files as part of the build deployment. To
specify this, you use what is known as the testconfigs file.

First, open up your unit testing project with visual studio, and from
the test menu item, select edit test configuration.

the enable deployment check box is **selected**.

Now, each time you run or deploy your projects you can select that
directories contents to also be copied over.
