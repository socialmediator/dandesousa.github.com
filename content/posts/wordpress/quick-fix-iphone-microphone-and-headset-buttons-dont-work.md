I recently had a problem with my iPhone headphones where neither the
built in mic nor the headphone answer (or start/stop) button would work.
I attributed the failure to a recent tumble which also crack my front
glass along the bezel.

Now, thanks to a helpful blog post I was able to correct the problem.
Seems like a rather large piece lint had made it's way into the
headphone jack and was blocking the plug. I would have never figured it
out if it wasn't for this helpful blog post. So I've linked it below and
will leave the explanation to him:
