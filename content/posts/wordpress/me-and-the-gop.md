So contrary to my better judgement I've decided to post an old video of
myself at the GOP convention back in the day. I remember I was a big
Republican, back when I really just wanted to be different than my
parents and I was told that abortion was murder. Anyway one good thing
that came from this was that I did a "mock" news reporting for the GOP
convention. Yes this is me in 2000, when I was about 12ish. I was
probably just about to turn 13. Anyway, hopefully you'll get a kick out
of it.
