I recently installed the iPad OS 4.3 beta and found that the gestures
were missing. A bit of tinkering around and I realized that actually I
had not yet turned on my iPad for development use (something required to
access these new features). If you are experiencing the same problems,
following these steps to enabled gestures on your iPad:

1.  Verify that gestures are not enabled
2.  Plug you iPad into your mac and bring up the xcode organizer and
    click "enable development use" on your iPad's summary screen.
3.  Kill and restart the settings app on your iPad
4.  Confirm you now have gestures.
