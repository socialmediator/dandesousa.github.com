So I came across a problem with WPF and context menus. Whenever I added
a context menu to a right click on a window or panel it would simple not
open. The only time that a context menu would appear is when I right
clicked on a button or label that was a child of the panel I added it
to. I searched everywhere online for a solution and couldn't find one.
Finally, I figured it out myself. For some strange reason, a context
menu will not appear if you to not manually set a background color for a
component or child component. So to fix the problem, simple set a
background color for which components you want the top level context
menu to appear.
