Summary: 

Switching your blog to a static site has a number of advantages, including speed, simplicity, transparency and control. One disadvantage, however, is usability. Static site generators like Pelican, encourage uses to create their own pages and posts, but lack a good management interface for creating those files. 

As a result, I've decided to create a project to assist with managing pelican sites through the command like, and its called [pelican-shovel]( https://github.com/dandesousa/pelican-shovel ). As a pelican user, I'll be eating my own dog food so to speak, and be adding features to assist with the management of my own blog. Currently it supports assisted generation of new pages and posts, list and editting those posts. Check out the [github page]( https://github.com/dandesousa/pelican-shovel ) for installation and usage details.
