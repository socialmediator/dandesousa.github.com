My name is Dan De Sousa and I'm a computer programmer living in Warrington, Pennsylvania.

I'm an independent developer trying to scratch out a living developing mobile and web applications.

I previously worked in the field of financial software and proprietary trading systems. I have worked as an intern at Motorola and Google.  My development experience ranging from Java, .NET, Python/C++ server development and most recently, objective-c and mobile application development.  I've created classic desktop applications, mobile applications, web applications, flash and 3d games, distributed AI systems, multi-touch interactive desktop apps.

My personal interests include reading, video games, camping, soccer, gambling, range shooting and spending time with family and close friends.

I believe strongly in giving advice and sharing experiences with the world. This site is intended as a forum for me to post the things I discover that give me trouble or I find interesting. I have articles on writing code, fixing roombas and TVs and other things that I think the rest of the world might be interested in. I love getting comments so feel free to leave them. If you have any questions about me you want to ask, feel free by e-mailing me <questions@dandesousa.com>. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions about programming, work life, ownership experiences etc.
