        <p>Switching your blog to a static site has a number of advantages, including speed, simplicity, transparency and control. One disadvantage, however, is usability. Static site generators like Pelican, encourage uses to create their own pages and posts, but lack a good management interface for creating those files. </p>
<p>As a result, I've decided to create a project to assist with managing pelican sites through the command like, and its called <a href="https://github.com/dandesousa/pelican-shovel">pelican-shovel</a>. As a pelican user, I'll be eating my own dog food so to speak, and be adding features to assist with the management of my own blog. Currently it supports assisted generation of new pages and posts, list and editting those posts. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/dandesousa/pelican-shovel">github page</a> for installation and usage details.</p>

        <p>Looking for a way to link together iCloud and Dropbox to manage your
photos? Look no further; the following is a guide to getting your iOS
and Photo Stream photos automatically into Dropbox.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dropbx-300x300.png" title="dropbx" /> <img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/icloud-300x297.jpg" title="icloud" /></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This  process started because I was looking for a way to manage all my
photos on my iPad. I want to take pictures with my DSLR or point and
shoot, download them to my iPad with the camera connection kit, and have
them automatically added to my cloud or local photo library.
Unfortunately many of the photo management services on the iPad are
lacking, and it is not easy to create and sync albums through iCloud.
What I really wanted was a permanent backup solution for photos on my
iPad. It would also be nice to be able to manage my photos with a third
party application like Picasa. That's when I thought to use Photo Stream
as a delivery mechanism to upload photos to Dropbox. I trust Dropbox to
keep my photos safe, and I like having access to all my photos on all my
devices. Of course, all these photos are going to take up a lot of space
over time. I cover the costs of this setup in the last section.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This setup will work on Windows or Mac, but I'll go over the
instructions for Windows. If there are requests I can post directions
for OS X, though it should be pretty straightforward from the following.</p>
<p>You'll need these applications:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1455">iCloud Control Panel</a></p>
<p>These instructions have you setup iCloud Control Panel to download your
Photo Stream uploaded photos (which includes all photos added to your
iOS through either the camera app or the camera connection kit) a
Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>First you'll want to make sure Dropbox is configured and setup for your
account.</p>
<p>Second after you install the iCloud Control Panel, you want to find it
under Control Panel > iCloud. You should see something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/icloudcontrolpanel.png" title="icloudcontrolpanel" /></p>
<p>Select options next to Photo Stream:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/options.png" title="options" /></p>
<p>Make sure that "My Photo Stream" is selected. Also check "Shared Photo
Streams" if you use that feature. Select "Change" next to "Photo Stream
location" and navigate to your Dropbox directory. You can either select
the Photos directory. In the follow example I've created a dedicated
directory just for my Photo Stream photos:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/files.png" title="files" /></p>
<p>Don't worry about the directories under "Photo Streams" they will appear
once your computer starts download photos from Apple. Once it's
selected, select "OK" all the way until you get back to the main control
panel window and close it.</p>
<p>From now on, all new pictures on your iOS device will automatically be
downloaded to your local machine, and since the location of the download
is in Dropbox, it will be uploaded to your Dropbox account as well.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>You might be asking why go through to the trouble of doing this. Well
there are a number of benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can access all your photos on all your devices, computers and on
    the web securely.</li>
<li>Manage your photo library solely from your iPad, iPhone with Dropbox
    and the Photos app.</li>
<li>Freedom to delete old photos from your iOS device without fear that
    they will disappear from iCloud after 30 days or when your 1000
    photo limit is reached. If dropbox is installed on your iOS device,
    you can even view them there long after they've disappeared from
    Photo Stream.</li>
<li>Automatically download photos to all your computers at once (as long
    as your computer with iCloud Control Panel is running)</li>
<li>Automatically upload photos to all your iOS devices from any
    computer in the world or the web by dropping them in the Photo
    Stream > Uploads folder (as long as your iCloud Control Panel
    computer is running)</li>
<li>"Own" all your photos, organize them into albums and make them
    accessible.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Long Term Costs</h2>
<p>This setup does not come without its costs. While iCloud and Photo
Stream are free for Photos, a new dropbox free user probably doesn't
have much room to be storing their entire photo library. In the long
term this will like depend on having a paid account. However, fret not,
since Dropbox is always running a number of promotions to increase
available space. The biggest is the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace">Dropbox Space Race</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/category/Referrals">referral
program</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/pricing">Dropbox's pricing details</a> which have
recently expanded. Furthermore, with the decrease in price of storage,
we should see costs come down and capacity go up in the coming years.</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment or suggest alternate setups. So far this has
been working quite well and allowing me to leverage the best of both of
these great cloud services.</p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>Plex just announced a great new syncing feature for iOS devices, but I
noticed that when I started syncing, my SSD would quickly fill up. It
turns out that as of the current release of plex server v0.9.7.3, you
cannot directly change the directory. However, you can change the entire
local application path for plex. There are instructions on the Plex wiki
detailing how this is done:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Plex_Media_Server_Preferences#Advanced_Preferences%20%20">Plex Wiki</a></p>
<p>In my case I set LocalAppDataPath in the registry to my RAID disc which
has plenty of storage. You'll have to follow the instructions for your
particular platform.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Make sure that when you change the path you copy your old
plex app data directory to preserve all your metadata, thumbnails, and
database. On Windows, its in "C:/Users/\&lt;USERNAME>/AppData/Local/Plex
Media Server". Also important, remember that the directory
Cache/Transcode/Sync <strong>MUST</strong> exist. I tried to delete the cache to save
myself some transfer time and when I was missing that
Cache/Transcode/Sync directory, PlexSync would not work at all. Once I
restored the directory, all was well.</p>
