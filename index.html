        <p>I recently left my secure job to pursue my dream of working for myself. In honor of new beginnings, I felt it appropriate that I migrate my website to github. As I plan to be a much more active member of the open source community, I decided to delve right in and move from wordpress to a github pages hosted site with a theme of my own design. I'll go over how I did this, the tools I used, the code I developed, etc. Convienently, these and the subsequent blog posts will server as test data for my theme / tool development.</p>
<h2>Why move away from something like Wordpress?</h2>
<p>This is an interesting question because is presumes something, mainly that given an already setup Wordpress site is not currently meeting your needs. For me those needs were control, visibility, simplicity. </p>
<p>I wanted control over how my site was generated. I wanted to understand everything that was going on under the hood. Unfortunately this meant learning, nay 'groking' PHP. While I admire and respect PHP as the "father" of server side web languages, I would feel much more comfortable having something depending only on python. Additionally, wordpress has dependencies like MySQL, which is yet another dependency I would rather not wish to have, given the low level of user interaction on my site.</p>
<p>So I decided to go with github pages, which lets me serve my content statically. I opted to go with pelican over jekyll. Again, opting for something written in python which I could assist with contributing right away, and because it provided a bit more flexibility in terms of templating and generation over jekyll and liquid. </p>
<h2>What works and what doesn't</h2>
<p>Right off the bat, I found that for just quickly getting setup, it pelican works great. It let's me choose the markup language I want, generate my page and commit to a separate branch in my github repo. However, I find myself wanting for page management and organization (something I plan to take a stab at in the near future). Additionally, while there is a fair amount of themes available for pelican, they aren't as numerous as jekyll or wordpress (of which there are literally thousands).</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>I plan on doing the following in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create my own theme</li>
<li>Create a set of util scripts to assist with pelican post / page management</li>

    <div class="span8">
      <div class="summary">
        <p>With all the debate surrounding firearms in the recently weeks, I
happened about a discussion with my pro-gun friend about suppressors.
Mostly commonly known as <em>silencers</em>, or the long black cylinder on the
end of James Bond's gun in the movies. He seemed asked me the most worn
out retort in gun debates across the country:</p>
<p><em>"But why would you ever need one (a silencer)?"</em></p>
</p>

<p>This was not an unforgivable question; but surprising one, considering
he is a firearm owner and regular shooter. You see, many gun control
advocates propose solutions based on false premises, and 'silencer' laws
are no exception. It doesn't help that even modern day
gun enthusiasts are willing to concede that they are dangerous. It's
easy pray for people like [Alexander Zaitchik, who wrote a scathing
article on the NRA's recent call for supressor regulation
relaxation.][]{{1}} When it comes to banning anything, I never ask
myself why should we have it. I ask "why not?".</p>
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Why</h2>
<p></p>
For those who have never shot a firearm before, you should consider what
these machines are capable of doing. In very simple terms: you pull the
trigger which ignites a primer and then gunpowder, which forces the
bullet out of the gun along the trajectory of the barrel. These bullets
exit the barrel at very high velocities typically measured in many
multiples of the speed sound. This causes a sonic boom, or displaced,
compressed shock wave, similar to that produced by supersonic aircraft.
But because the bullet is so small relative to an aircraft, it is not
nearly as loud (though still very noticeable). If you never either fired
a gun or sat on a tarmac, you will never even experience hearing
anything of that level of volume. When you see actors firing guns on
television and in movies, they wear no ear protection, yet never once
flinch and walk away in perfect health. Please realize that you are not
hearing or seeing real gun fire. What you hear through your speakers is
far less than what you would hear even with ear protection at any firing
range.</p>
<p>Actually discharging a firearm can cause serious damage to your hearing.
The ancillary benefit is that other can hear the discharge and call for
help or react if necessary. What I will try and prove is that perceived
ability of silencers is far from reality and that they are far more
useful to law abiding citizens than anyone seeking to cause harm.</p>
<h2>The Facts</h2>
</p>

<p>Most common firearms all produce decibel ratings within a fairly common
range of 150-165db, depending on caliber and barrel.{{2}} We can assume
a decibel rating of 150db.</p>
</p>

<p>To understand how much damage that can do to the human ear:</p>
<p></p>
<strong>Hearing Damage Risk Levels in Decibels:{{3}}</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>85 dB:</strong> Beginning of OSHA regulations</li>
<li>
<p><strong>90 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>8 Hours</strong> of Sound
    Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lawn Mower</li>
<li>Truck Traffic</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>95 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damager After <strong>4 Hours</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Motorcycle</li>
<li>Power Saw</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>100 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>2 Hours</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Chainsaw</li>
<li>Stereo Headphones</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>105 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>1 Hour</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jackhammer</li>
<li>Helicopter</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>110 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>30 Minutes</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Snowmobile from Driver Seat</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>115 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>15 Minutes</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Baby's Cry</li>
<li>Stadium Football Game</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>120 dB:</strong> Risk of Hearing Damage After <strong>7.5 Minutes</strong> of Sound
Exposure</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rock Concert</li>
<li>Sandblasting</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
-   <strong>140 dB:</strong> <strong>Immediate Hearing Damage</strong></p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Gunshot</li>
<li>Jet Engine Taking Off</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In other words, any discharge from a firearm without hearing protection
<em>IMMEDIATELY</em> begins to cause hearing damage. Sustained or repeated
exposure (i.e. repeated gunshots) worsens the damage. My personal ear
protection, with one of the highest decibel ratings I could find,
reduces this by <em>30db</em>, bringing the level to <em>120db,</em> but outside of
the immediate danger zone. Since most muzzle noise exposure is for
milliseconds, we can be confident that our ears are safe.</p>
</p>

<p>And what about silencers? How much noise is that soft "punk" out of
Bond's gun that lets him sneak around undetected? Since those bad guys,
could presumably hear someone talking, we can make an educated guess
from the movie, that it should be well below the 65 decibels of human
speech. Well, according to independent tests{{4}}, firearm suppressors
reduce noise by an average of -- suprise, suprise -- <em>30db</em>. Or, just
enough to not cause immediate, irreparable hearing damage. Consider that
for a moment, putting a silencer on your gun is the equivalent of giving
everyone in the area ear protection. Even then, our chart indicates that
we'd still be exposed to a level of noise equivalent to a live concert,
clearly enough for anyone within range of the firearm to hear.</p>
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">The Why Not</h2>
<p></p>
So to answer my friend's question, a silencer could easily be used to
assist someone who is using a gun in their home for self defense. No one
is going to wait to put on their ear protection in an emergency, but
they could keep the suppressor on their home defense firearm.
Additionally, suppressors reduce the risk of harm in defending, say, a
child's bedroom. They also reduce muzzle flash and make it less like to
induce disorientation.</p>
<p>Would they enable someone to sneak around and dispatch people
undetected? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>
<p>Do they make firearms silent or more dangerous? <strong>No</strong>.</p>
<p>Do they make firearms safer to discharge? <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<h2>Beware of Truth</h2>
<p></p>
I implore anyone who reads this to please do research on all the facts
before decided to strip rights away from others. On the matter of gun
control, more than any other, I find that people are willing to
compromise critical thinking for confirmation bias. That makes everyone
less safe.</p>
<p>Luckily suppressors are not entirely illegal, but they are not easily
accessible. They require federal registration and a long waiting period.
They are also not transferrable or legal in certain states.</p>

    <div class="span8">
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Looking for a way to link together iCloud and Dropbox to manage your
photos? Look no further; the following is a guide to getting your iOS
and Photo Stream photos automatically into Dropbox.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dropbx-300x300.png" title="dropbx" /> <img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/icloud-300x297.jpg" title="icloud" /></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This  process started because I was looking for a way to manage all my
photos on my iPad. I want to take pictures with my DSLR or point and
shoot, download them to my iPad with the camera connection kit, and have
them automatically added to my cloud or local photo library.
Unfortunately many of the photo management services on the iPad are
lacking, and it is not easy to create and sync albums through iCloud.
What I really wanted was a permanent backup solution for photos on my
iPad. It would also be nice to be able to manage my photos with a third
party application like Picasa. That's when I thought to use Photo Stream
as a delivery mechanism to upload photos to Dropbox. I trust Dropbox to
keep my photos safe, and I like having access to all my photos on all my
devices. Of course, all these photos are going to take up a lot of space
over time. I cover the costs of this setup in the last section.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This setup will work on Windows or Mac, but I'll go over the
instructions for Windows. If there are requests I can post directions
for OS X, though it should be pretty straightforward from the following.</p>
<p>You'll need these applications:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1455">iCloud Control Panel</a></p>
<p>These instructions have you setup iCloud Control Panel to download your
Photo Stream uploaded photos (which includes all photos added to your
iOS through either the camera app or the camera connection kit) a
Dropbox folder.</p>
<p>First you'll want to make sure Dropbox is configured and setup for your
account.</p>
<p>Second after you install the iCloud Control Panel, you want to find it
under Control Panel > iCloud. You should see something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/icloudcontrolpanel.png" title="icloudcontrolpanel" /></p>
<p>Select options next to Photo Stream:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/options.png" title="options" /></p>
<p>Make sure that "My Photo Stream" is selected. Also check "Shared Photo
Streams" if you use that feature. Select "Change" next to "Photo Stream
location" and navigate to your Dropbox directory. You can either select
the Photos directory. In the follow example I've created a dedicated
directory just for my Photo Stream photos:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/files.png" title="files" /></p>
<p>Don't worry about the directories under "Photo Streams" they will appear
once your computer starts download photos from Apple. Once it's
selected, select "OK" all the way until you get back to the main control
panel window and close it.</p>
<p>From now on, all new pictures on your iOS device will automatically be
downloaded to your local machine, and since the location of the download
is in Dropbox, it will be uploaded to your Dropbox account as well.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>You might be asking why go through to the trouble of doing this. Well
there are a number of benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can access all your photos on all your devices, computers and on
    the web securely.</li>
<li>Manage your photo library solely from your iPad, iPhone with Dropbox
    and the Photos app.</li>
<li>Freedom to delete old photos from your iOS device without fear that
    they will disappear from iCloud after 30 days or when your 1000
    photo limit is reached. If dropbox is installed on your iOS device,
    you can even view them there long after they've disappeared from
    Photo Stream.</li>
<li>Automatically download photos to all your computers at once (as long
    as your computer with iCloud Control Panel is running)</li>
<li>Automatically upload photos to all your iOS devices from any
    computer in the world or the web by dropping them in the Photo
    Stream > Uploads folder (as long as your iCloud Control Panel
    computer is running)</li>
<li>"Own" all your photos, organize them into albums and make them
    accessible.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Long Term Costs</h2>
<p>This setup does not come without its costs. While iCloud and Photo
Stream are free for Photos, a new dropbox free user probably doesn't
have much room to be storing their entire photo library. In the long
term this will like depend on having a paid account. However, fret not,
since Dropbox is always running a number of promotions to increase
available space. The biggest is the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace">Dropbox Space Race</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/category/Referrals">referral
program</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/pricing">Dropbox's pricing details</a> which have
recently expanded. Furthermore, with the decrease in price of storage,
we should see costs come down and capacity go up in the coming years.</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment or suggest alternate setups. So far this has
been working quite well and allowing me to leverage the best of both of
these great cloud services.</p>
