      <div class="summary">
        <p>So, I finally got around to re-organizing my home server situation, and
was given a RocketRaid 2640x4 SAS Raid Controller from a friend. My
intention was to simply use it for the extra SATA slots and not bother
with its own on-board RAID. However, when I tried to get it to work, I
noticed that the drives weren't being detected under Ubuntu. I scored
the internet until I finally found a post from a newegg buyer that
resolved my issue and I feel its important enough to post.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to follow to get this controller to work
under Linux. They may work for all versions of Linux but I have not
tried them.</p>
<p>1.) Flash the BIOS to legacy</p>
<p>If you don't need the RAID features, you can flash the BIOS on the card
to replace the current BIOS with a legacy BIOS <em>sans</em> RAID. To do this,
simply download the legacy BIOS from the Highpoint website. You can then
either run the highpoint flash utility under windows or you'll need to
create a DOS boot disk. If you have access to a Windows box, using the
utility is the easier course of action. When you extract the BIOS zip it
should be listed as hptflash.exe and look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Capture-300x178.png" title="Capture" /></p>
<p>2.) Configure the drive to be under legacy mode</p>
<p>Now plug you card back into the linux box and make sure that all the
drives connected to the card are listed as "legacy" in the RocketRaid
RAID utility that appears when you boot your machine (You may need to
press CTRL+H when the appropriate screen appears).</p>
<p>3.) Download and Compile the Driver Source</p>
<p>Now you need to make sure the drivers are properly installed. I got
issues when I tried to install the pre-built binaries. Luckily its
pretty easy to compile the drivers yourself. Simply download the
<em>legacy</em> drives from the RocketRaid site on the same page as the BIOS.
Now just cd in the lowest level of the source directory and type "sudo
make install". You'll see it build and then you are done!</p>
<p>The drivers will then be installed. If you reboot and check ls /dev you
should see a drive labeled sd\&lt;*> for every drive connect to the card
or your motherboard. Enjoy!</p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>So I just got a new camcorder thanks to now qualifying for the US
stimulus package from back in April. I was looking around for something
to help stimulate the economy and decided that I should get a camcorder
while prices are low and money is high. Anyway, the HF100 is flash based
and really nice. It records in full HD 1080p with pretty decent picture
quality, though I have yet to record in full light setting (outside). So
far I only have sort of dim shots indoors of my roommate's cats and my
ferret.</p>
<p>Anyway in my commitment to making a post with something useful every
week, I've decided to share a tip with the world. Seems as though when I
installed my ImageMixer 3 SE software, it would just freeze upon
startup. Normally I wouldn't mind the issue with crap proprietary
software, but there is no easy way to edit .MTS/M2TS files without
converting and losing quality. Since I prefer to keep the originals as
well as edit them so that extra footage is chopped off, I needed to
figure out what was wrong. After some digging I found the solution to my
problem.</p>
<p>If this occurs for you, you need to install all third party codec packs
you installed. I had the CCCP (Community Codec Pak), which is useful for
watching MKVs. Unfortunately, that was messing up something, so I had to
uninstall it. I found numerous posts talking about uninstalling codec
packs, so that's probably the way to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that eliminates the ability to play back MKV's in WMV. I
don't have a solution for this but I suggest installing <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. It is
wonderful and plays everything.</p>

    <h3>How To: Dual Monitors In Ubuntu With Nvidia</h3>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>I noticed that a lot of people are getting "cannot parse xorg.conf"
message when they try to set up dual monitors with Nvidia settings
manager in ubuntu. Here is the solution.</p>
<p>On the command line:</p>
<p>
    sudo nvidia-xconfig

</p>

<p>You should see it tell you that it overrode your xorg.conf. If you get
warnings don't worry, it's likely just indicating that there was a
previous problem. Then on the command line again, type this:</p>
<p>
    sudo nvidia-settings

</p>

<p>Now setup your dual monitor or triple monitor configuration as you want
(with Twin View and the correct orientation). Then hit save
configuration at the bottom and you should see that you get no error.</p>
<p>Reboot and enjoy.</p>
